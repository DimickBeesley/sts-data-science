# sts-data-science

## Goals

Don't have any big ones at the moment. I just know I want this to be an opportunity to practice web-scraping, the data-science tools in python, and pairing python with Java to do some powerful things. Maybe I'll make a bot, stat comparisons btw me and the average Ascension 20 player and/or Jorbs himself. I might also make something to help evaluate card and relic pics in game for a mod or something. I'll have a better idea once I've gathered and structured the data I know I'll need for all of those, and more about making some tools that would make things like this much easier later.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
